This directory contains wrappers for the OpenNLP java-based tools for
sentence detection, tokenization, pos-tagging, chunking and parsing,
named-entity detection, and coreference. The tools use the Maxent
machine learning package.

The wrappers use the following libraries:

OpenNLP Tools from <https://opennlp.apache.org/>
OpenNLP Maxent from <https://opennlp.apache.org/>

All of the above libraries are redistributed here under the GNU Lesser
General Public License (LGPL) Version 2.1, a copy of which can be
found in the file LICENSE.

By default, the wrappers use models for English which can be found in
models/english directory. The models are copies of those available at
<http://opennlp.sourceforge.net/models-1.5/>.  These models have also
been redistributed here under the GNU Lesser General Public License
(LGPL) Version 2.1, a copy of which can be found in the file LICENSE.


Thanks are due to Georgi D. Georgiev of Ontotext for originally
wrapping the OpenNLP tools for GATE, and to the OpenNLP project.
