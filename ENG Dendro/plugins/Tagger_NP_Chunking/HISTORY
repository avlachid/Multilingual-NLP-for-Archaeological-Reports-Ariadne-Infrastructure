v1.1 Invalid Chunk Release (02/06/2005)
=======================================
The main change is that there is now a check to make sure the
annotations added by the GATE wrapper are valid. It turns out
that in some weird cases the end offset was before the start
offset and although GATE would accept this as an annotation
doing any further processing of the text usually failed
miserably. Clearly I should try and figure out what is causing
these invalid offsets but for now this will suffice.

v1.0_04 Combined Release (26/03/2005)
=====================================
For some reason some of the changes from previous versions got
lost in the 1.0_03 build, so this makes sure everything is
done properly. So now empty lines are handled, the GATE annotation
is NounChunk (no space) and if the config files are not specified
when loading the GATE module then the defaults will be loaded from
the JAR file.

v1.0_03 Annotation Name Change (13/01/2005)
===========================================
If you use the chunker inside GATE then this release changes the
default annotation name from "Noun Chunk" to "NounChunk" so that
GATE can save tagged documents in XML with well formed tags.
This is the only change in this release.

v1.0_02 Empty Line Release (12/01/2005)
=======================================
Added some code to handle empty lines in the data files which
were causing the initialisation of the chunker to fail.

v1.0_01 Clarified Release (06/12/2003)
======================================
Added a Unix/Linux build script which seems to work, at least under
cygwin on Windows haven't managed to actually test it on a Unix box
yet. Also updated the README file to explain about what other GATE
modules are needed to run the chunker within GATE. And finally I
added this file to the release.

v1.0 First Public Release (05/12/2003)
======================================
Not much to say really it works but hasn't been optimized and some
of the Unix/Linux scripts are missing or untested.
